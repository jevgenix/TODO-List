# What the project does and why it is useful
Greetings new user, this is a todo-list project. With this product you can organize your daily routine. The functionality of this product is based on adding to the list of things that you want to do, crossing out these things and eventually deleting them. The list of things will be saved in local memory until you yourself delete them from the todo-list itself. 

There is also a small additional functionality in the project, such as a warning about a possible error, for example, if the user tries to add an empty value to the list. There is also an additional opportunity to organize the to-do list by selecting the entire list, the list of completed tasks, and the list of unfinished tasks. Unfortunately, the project is not fully optimized, for example, no, since the web page is not responsive, and therefore the GUI on the phone will not look pleasant.

# How users can get started with the project
You can easily start working with a project by simply writing a text in the Input and clicking the todo button afterwards.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project
The project was created by Evgenii Smornov. He is also responcible for maintaining and contributing the project.
